## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside
The PDF is organized into three skill levels:

### ðŸ”¹ Beginner Techniques (Foundations)
- **Role Prompting** â€“ assign the AI a persona  
- **Instruction + Context + Constraint** â€“ structure prompts for clarity  
- **Zero-shot vs. Few-shot Prompting** â€“ examples vs. no examples  
- **Output Formatting** â€“ JSON, tables, bullet points  

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Techniques (Better Control)
- **Chain of Thought (CoT)** â€“ step-by-step reasoning  
- **Tree of Thought (ToT)** â€“ multiple reasoning paths  
- **Self-Reflection / Critique Prompts** â€“ model improves its own output  
- **Delimiters & Separation** â€“ structure prompts with markers  

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Techniques (Pro-Level)
- **Prompt Chaining** â€“ multi-step workflows  
- **Generated Knowledge Prompting** â€“ recall + reasoning  
- **Negative Prompting** â€“ define what to avoid  
- **RAG / Context Injection** â€“ bring in external documents

##âœ¨ Bonus: Magic Prompt

What it is: An optimized, expanded version of a prompt that yields higher-quality results.
For LLMs: Turns vague instructions into structured, role-based, and constraint-driven prompts.
For Image Models (Stable Diffusion, MidJourney): Expands short prompts into rich descriptions with style, lighting, mood, and technical tags.
