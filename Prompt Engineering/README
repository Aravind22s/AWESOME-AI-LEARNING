## 🚀 What’s Inside
The PDF is organized into three skill levels:

### 🔹 Beginner Techniques (Foundations)
- **Role Prompting** – assign the AI a persona  
- **Instruction + Context + Constraint** – structure prompts for clarity  
- **Zero-shot vs. Few-shot Prompting** – examples vs. no examples  
- **Output Formatting** – JSON, tables, bullet points  

### 🔹 Intermediate Techniques (Better Control)
- **Chain of Thought (CoT)** – step-by-step reasoning  
- **Tree of Thought (ToT)** – multiple reasoning paths  
- **Self-Reflection / Critique Prompts** – model improves its own output  
- **Delimiters & Separation** – structure prompts with markers  

### 🔹 Advanced Techniques (Pro-Level)
- **Prompt Chaining** – multi-step workflows  
- **Generated Knowledge Prompting** – recall + reasoning  
- **Negative Prompting** – define what to avoid  
- **RAG / Context Injection** – bring in external documents
